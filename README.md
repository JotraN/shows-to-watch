# Shows to Watch
Ever wonder what shows I am currently watching? Me too.  
This is a rails application I made to keep track of shows I am currently watching.  
It is currently hosted via heroku's free plan <a href="http://showstowatch.josephtran.io/">here</a>.

## Want to suggest a show to watch?
Sign up <a href="http://showstowatch.josephtran.io/users/sign_up">here</a>.  
After signing up, you can request admin access by clicking the request link on the right side of the nav bar.  
I will review your request and grant you admin access (if you meet all qualifications to be an admin).

## Other Info
TV show images are hosted and taken from <a href="http://thetvdb.com/">The TVDB</a>.  
I request that any of this application's users help contribute information and artwork to <a href="http://thetvdb.com/">the TVDB</a>.
